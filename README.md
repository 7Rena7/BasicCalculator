# BasicCalculator
A basic calculator with a user interface using WinForms

How this calculator works:
1. Insert the equation in the textbox.
2. Press Enter or the = button.
3. The result should appear in the label below the textbox.

If the equation is invalid (ex: a number contains two periods), an error message will appear in the output label
